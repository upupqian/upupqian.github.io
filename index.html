  <h1>Welcome to My Beautifully Chaotic Corner of the Internet — Where Entropy Sparks Ideas</h1>

  <p>
    This website brings together <strong>polymer materials</strong>, <strong>cell mechanics</strong>, 
    and <strong>embedded systems</strong> — an odd mix, perhaps, but one that reflects the joyful messiness 
    of a curious mind. If you're wondering why these fields coexist here, the short answer is: they do, 
    because I do.
  </p>

  <p>
    What began as a structured academic journey has evolved into something freer, broader — and yes, a little chaotic.
    But out of chaos often comes creativity. This site is where experiments, ideas, and half-finished thoughts 
    meet, mingle, and occasionally turn into something meaningful.

    I believe learning doesn’t need to stay in tidy boxes. Whether it’s molecules, cells, or microcontrollers, 
    each tells a story — and together, they tell mine.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you find a spark of inspiration here, this website has done its job.<br>
    If you share your thoughts or suggestions, then together, we’ve already started something valuable.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Let’s explore this chaos — and create something extraordinary.</strong></p>
