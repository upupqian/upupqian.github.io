<h1>Embedded Development</h1>
<p>
My journey into embedded development didn’t begin in a classroom — it began with a need to build tools for my research.  
From custom microscopes to motorized platforms, code became my screwdriver, and microcontrollers became my lab assistants.  
It’s low-level, it’s messy, and it’s wonderfully real. Even toy cars owe them a thank-you.
