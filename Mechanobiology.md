<h1>Mechanobiology</h1>
<p>
Long before Newton had his apple moment, mechanobiology was already happening — cells were sensing forces,
bending, stretching, and surviving. Ironically, our understanding of mechanical cues came far later than biochemical ones.  
For me, this journey began not with Newton, but during my master’s degree, when I first started trying to understand how cells respond to force.
