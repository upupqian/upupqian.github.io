I firmly believe that nothing progresses without materials. Unfortunately, the world often disagrees.  
Materials are overlooked — perhaps because they’re abstract, not easily captured by equations, or simply underappreciated.  
But for those of us who shape them, study them, or dream through them — they are the silent architects of everything.
